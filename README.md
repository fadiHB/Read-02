# The Command Line!

**A command line, or terminal** is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.


The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands. Here is an example:

**The Shell, Bash**
Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you. There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell
